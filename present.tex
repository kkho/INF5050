  \frametitle{What is MPLS?}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item MPLS is a scalable data-carrying mechanism that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than network addresses.
        \item Every network packet is assigned at least one label and packet-forwarding decisions are based on them exclusivly, rather than the content of the packets.
        \item Operates somewhere between layer 2 (data link layer) and layer 3 (network layer). Considered a "layer 2.5" protocol.
        \item Standardized by the IETF in 1996. Based on work done by Ipsilon Networks and Cisco.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why MPLS?}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Avoids complex lookups in the routing table.
		\item Allow core routers/networking devices to switch packets based on a simplified header.
        \item Create end-to-end circuits using any protocol over any IP capable transport medium.
		\item Provide a highly scalable mechanism that was topology driven rather than flow driven.
		\item Provides load-balancing functionality for traffic to utilize network bandwidth more efficiently.
		\item Remove the complexity and overhead of network managements (Assemble and reassemble IP packets).		
        \item Shortest path routing protocols like IS-IS and OSPF do not take capacity characteristics into account when making routing decisions. This leads to some network nodes being congested while others remain under-utilized.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{MPLS Fundamentals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By attaching a short fixed-length label to packets at the ingress to an MPLS domain these labels can be used to make forwarding decisions within that domain.
        \item These label switched paths may be explicitly routed if desired and can provides QoS if it is implemented with Diff-Serv and Constraint-based routing.
        \item MPLS consists of a control plane and a forwarding plane that are decoupled/independent.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{MPLS Fundamentals: Control Plane}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item The MPLS control plane is a collection of protocols that provide network level functionality in MPLS networks.
	    \item These protocols are implemented as software processes that communicate with each other across node boundaries using message passing techniques.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They facilitate the establishment of label switched paths in the MPLS networks by setting them up and tearing them down using signaling functions.
		\item The control plane distributes and manages network topology and resource availability information using a routing protocol
		\item These protocols include the legacy IP routing and signaling protocols.
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{MPLS Fundamentals: Forwarding Plane}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The MPLS forwarding plane is the datapath user traffic is sent through. 
	    \begin{itemize}
		    \item The forwarding plane performs label swapping operations using lookup tables.
            \item Additionally it performs all miscellaneous packet treatment functions such as scheduling, queue management, rate shaping, policing and others.
		    \item It is generally implemented in hardware due to the need for such operations to be done really quickly.
	    \end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Group of IP packets which are forwarded in the same manner (e.g. over the same path, with the same priority and the same label)
			\end{itemize}
			
		\item Label
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Short fixed length identifier which is used to identify a FEC
			\end{itemize}						
			
		\item Label Swapping
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Looking up the oncoming label to determine the outgoing label, encapsulation and port
			\end{itemize}
			
		\item Label switched path (LSP)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Path through one or more LSR for a particular FEC
			\end{itemize}
		\item Label switching router (LSR)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item an MPLS capable router

	\frametitle{What is a Label?}
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item an extra layer that "sits" between L2 and L3 layer
		known as header 2.5 (or "shim")
		\item don't need to lookup at the routing table, you use the label information
		to find the next hop
		\item creates a VPN rather than public networks
		\item isolates other traffics running on the network

	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What is a Label?}
	Header information
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf{Label value: }}the label itself for lookup in the MPLS forwarding table
		\item {\bf{EXP field: }}gives Diffserv support on the MPLS network and carry the IP precedence value from the IP packet.
		\item {\bf{Stack bit: }}Indicates the bottom of the MPLS header stack has been reached.
		\item {\bf{Time-To-Live: }}prevents loop and path tracing in the MPLS network. This value decrements with each hop and packet discards occur at a zero value.

\frametitle{Traffic Engineering}
	Traffic engineering deals with performance optimization of operational ip networks. We want to transport ip packetsw in the most efficent reliable and expeditious manner possible through a given network.
    Avoid congestion and revocer from them when caused by poor resource allocation.
Overutilized and congested resources with alternative viable paths that are under utilized.
Generally: place traffic where the capacity exists to accommodate it.
The ability to enable constraint-based routing in IP networks is one of the achievements of mpls that makes it particularly useful for traffic engineering.

\frametitle{Tactical MPLS Traffic Engineering}
    Ad-hoc approach
    Optimize network performance by establishing and managing explicit LSP to adrress very specificnetwork performance problems.
    For example: Create new LSPs to divert traffic away from congested network resources onto under-utilized alternatives.
    Hybrid approaich: Use LSPs in some segments of the network while using interior gateway routing protocol metrics to control paths in other segments of the network.

%\frametitle{Disadvantages of MPLS}
%	MPLS has performance issues in the network:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item constraint-based routing
%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item Problem with computation of paths for LSPs subject to various types of constraints.
%				\item NP-complete problem
%			\end{itemize}
%		\item traffic partitioning and assignment
%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item This problem deals with the optimal partitioning and assignment of traffic to parallel LSPs between pairs of MPLS ingress and egress nodes.
%			\end{itemize}					
%		\item Low visibility and lack of access into the MPLS cloud. How to monitor that your carrier is delivering the correct performance? 
 %           \begin{itemize}
 %              \item Trace-route and ping no longer an option.
 %               \item Probes are costly and difficult to maintain.
 %           \end{itemize}
 %       \item restoration

  \frametitle{GMPLS}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item What is GMPLS?
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item  a protocol suite extending MPLS to manage further classes of interfaces and switching technologies other than packet interfaces and switching, such as time division multiplex, layer-2 switch, wavelength switch and fiber-switch.
  	\end{itemize}
  \item GMPLS advocates and promotes explicit separation of the control plane from the underlying data/forwarding plane.
  \item Gives the ability to let products from different vendors to inter-operate at a control level in different types of switched transport networks.

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{GMPLS}
	\begin{itemize}								
  \item Allows new and innovative ways to inter-connect various technologies and different layers, without restricting the way individual layers interwork with each other. 
  \item It simplifies the design, deployment and operations management of heterogeneous networks consisting of an assortment of packet and circuit switched equipment from different manufacturers.
  \item consists of three main aspects: routing , signaling and link management.
\end{itemize}		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It also explicitly decouples the control channel from the transport or bearer channels.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item gives an important implications on the fault handling characteristics of the control plane.
		\item failure in the control plane does not imply failure of the transport plane.
